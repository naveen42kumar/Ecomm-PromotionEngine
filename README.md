# Ecomm-PromotionEngine
Promotion engine is a solution to calculate the total cart value after applying the 2 promotion types.
   * Buy 'n' items of a SKU for a fixed price (3 A's for 130)
   * Buy SKU1 & SKU2 for a fixed price (C + D = 30)
  and open to add any upcoming rules.

Followed 
 * test driven approach to implement the solution.
 * Layered architecture to maintain the loose coupling
 * If time permited would have implemented with DI, full DAL, DB etc
